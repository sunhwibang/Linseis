# Linseis LSR-3 Data Tool
Data extraction and evaluation tool for Linseis LSR-3 800 Seebeck coefficient &amp; electric conductivity measurement. Taking below measured data as an input:

* Time (min)
* Temperature (C)
* Temperature Gradient (C)
* Resistivity (uOhm * m)
* Relative Seebeck Coefficient (uV/K)

and the tool plots:

* Seebeck Coefficient vs. Temperature
* Resistivity vs. Temperature
* Conductivity vs. Temperature
* Power Factor vs. Temperature

## Getting Started

MATLAB_R2017a was used to develop this tool. Older version of MATLAB and [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) can also run the tool.

### Prerequisites

#### Exporting ACSII From Linseis Data Software

1. Click 'ACSII-Export' on the top function bar in the Linseis Data Evaluation Program 


```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
